In order to combat the Soviets, the Americans had used their dominance of the ocean and superior economic geography to purchase an alliance\u0026rdquo;\nThe end of the world is just beginning, pg 40 America\u0026rsquo;s offered military protection of trade and consumption of alliance members exports\nBretton Woods alliance deteriorated without a common enemy (the last was the Soviets)\nDespite Bretton Woods officially ending in 1976, the Americans still provided overwatch for global trade until the 90s. America\u0026rsquo;s overwatch allowed for market access to expand steadily throughout the globe\nThe rise of globalisation came at the cost of fertility rates (pg 49)\nChildren went from free labour in an agrarian society to expensive furniture in an industrialized one Globalisation caused the destruction of small towns and the prominence of cities\nGlobalisation allowed countries to industrialise beyond their natural capabilities by importing energy\nGlobalisation resulted in mass reductions in mortality, mass extensions of life spans, mass expansions in population, and mass reductions in birth rates\nDemographic Collapse One feature of globalisation is that countries that were late to industrialise could travel down the paths that other had blazed\nBirthrates started to collapse in the developed world around the 1960s\nBetween 1980 to 2015 most countries can be placed into two buckets (pg 54)\nIn the first are countries early in their demographic transition\nEconomies of such countries rapidly expanded, mortality rate fell, lifespans extended but birth rates didn\u0026rsquo;t tank immediately and the supply of young workers remained steady for a time\nThese countries had excess consumption\nIn the second are countries that started their demographic transition later\nThese countries enjoyed the same economic booms, but suffered from the fact that birth rates started to fall almost immediately (i.e Mexico, Germany) as they followed in the footsteps of their predecessors\nThese countries lack a young populace to consume. The America\u0026rsquo;s world order established through Bretton Woods allowed them access to a global market to offload their production.\nThese countries became export driven\nBy 2020 most developed countries are starting to run out of young workers to hold up their economy\nA population crash will happen when these young workers, few in numbers, enter their forties as birth rates begin to collapse (see South Korea with 0.8 Births per female) The countries that transformed the fastest when industrializing (South Korea, China, Mexico, etc) will have a faster population collapse than those countries that started their industrialization process early (US, NZ, AUS, etc)\nChina has the fastest aging society in human history. Japan, Korea, Germany, Russia, Canada, and Spain are not far behind ","permalink":"https://tzenker.github.io/the-end-of-the-world-is-just-beginning/","summary":"META A place to write down my thoughts about the book NOTES Globalisation Globalisation began during World War II when the Americas negotiated Bretton Woods among 44 countries (pg39)\n\u0026ldquo;the absence of a high degree of economic collaboration among the leading nations will ‚Ä¶ inevitably result in economic warfare that will be but the prelude and instigator of military warfare on an even vaster scale\u0026rdquo;\nEconomic Security and the Origins of the Cold War, 1945‚Äì1950 Military competition was banned amongst the participants","title":"üìùüìöThe end of the world is just beginning"},{"content":"Title 1 foooo\nTitle 2 foooo\n","permalink":"https://tzenker.github.io/pages/random-page-from-logseq/","summary":"Title 1 foooo\nTitle 2 foooo","title":"random page form logseq"}]
